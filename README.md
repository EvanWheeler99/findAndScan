# Find and Scan

Scan.sh and Scan.cpp are both programs that scan the current directory for files with the given sufix, sorts them by file size, and return the top N results. It then also displays information about the size of all files with the given suffix and what percentage of that size the N files take up.

myFind.cpp is a program that uses c++ system calls to mirror the functionality of the bash command "$ find . -type f".
